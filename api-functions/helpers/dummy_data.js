      "Category Description": "Data Model, ML Model, and AI Model are distinct concepts in the field of data and machine learning. Here\u2019s a brief explanation of each:\n\nData Model:\n\nA data model is a conceptual representation or structure that defines how data is organized, stored, and manipulated within a system or application.\nIt specifies the relationships between different data entities, the attributes of those entities, and the rules governing the data.\nData models can be represented using diagrams such as entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs) or through schema definitions in databases.\nML Model (Machine Learning Model):\n\nAn ML model is a mathematical or computational representation of a real-world process or problem that can be learned from data.\nML models are created using machine learning algorithms and techniques to analyze and learn patterns from training data.\nThese models are then used to make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data.\nExamples of ML models include linear regression, decision trees, support vector machines, neural networks, etc.\nAI Model (Artificial Intelligence Model):\n\nAn AI model is a broader term that encompasses ML models and other advanced techniques used to mimic or simulate human intelligence.\nAI models can include ML models but may also involve additional components such as natural language processing, computer vision, knowledge representation, and reasoning.\nThese models are designed to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as understanding and generating natural language, recognizing objects in images, or making complex decisions. \nSUMMARY:\nData model represents the structure and organization of data, an ML model is a learned model that can make predictions based on data, and an AI model is a broader term encompassing ML models and other advanced techniques used to simulate human intelligence. These concepts are all interconnected but have distinct purposes and scopes in the realm of data and machine learning.",

This article will walk you through the basics you need to know. BI Reporting is divided into two categories in business intelligence. Managed reporting occurs when a technical employee such as an IT associate or data analyst prepares the data for non-technical users. Ad-hoc reporting in a BI platform allows non-technical users to create reports from scratch or edit pre-existing reports without having to make requests from IT. Reports allow business users to see data trends over time, slice and dice tables to discover relationships between variables. Smart BI tools have features like Natural Language Processing (NLP) so users can query the data using questions without coding. Reports can take various formats: tables, spreadsheets, and PDFs are all common outputs. Visualizations can include charts, graphs, or histograms. Reports can also be customized dashboards accessed through a web browser. With current technology, BI reports can be automated, and run on a pre-determined schedule",

Ad-hoc reporting in a BI platform allows non-technical users to create reports from scratch or edit pre-existing reports without having to make requests from IT.

This article will walk you through the basics you need to know. BI Reporting is divided into two categories in business intelligence. Managed reporting occurs when a technical employee such as an IT associate or data analyst prepares the data for non-technical users. Ad-hoc reporting in a BI platform allows non-technical users to create reports from scratch or edit pre-existing reports without having to make requests from IT. Reports allow business users to see data trends over time, slice and dice tables to discover relationships between variables. Smart BI tools have features like Natural Language Processing (NLP) so users can query the data using questions without coding. Reports can take various formats: tables, spreadsheets, and PDFs are all common outputs. Visualizations can include charts, graphs, or histograms. Reports can also be customized dashboards accessed through a web browser. With current technology, BI reports can be automated, and run on a pre-determined schedule",

Reports can also be customized dashboards accessed through a web browser. With current technology, BI reports can be automated, and run on a pre-determined schedule",

These regulations balance a company\u2019s need for collecting user data and an individual\u2019s right to control their personal information. \nData Privacy Law: Major Regulations and Common Requirements \nDifferent jurisdictions often have unique data privacy regulations and laws, making it crucial to adhere to rules specific to your jurisdiction. While each law has its own requirements, data privacy compliance typically consists of certain common practices, such as the following: \n\n#1Cybersecurity measures that prevent unauthorized access. \nTransparent communication about how user information is collected, stored, and used. \n#2Providing users with options regarding which parties receive their personal data. \n#3Respecting users\u2019 choice to opt out of data collection. In some jurisdictions, your organization may not be permitted to collect any personal information unless the user opts in first. \n#4Respecting individuals\u2019 rights and acting on specific requests relating to their personal data processing. \n#5Ensuring third parties with whom you share consumer data meet certain security and privacy standards. \n#6ransparent and timely communication regarding data breaches.",
